    <p id = "instructions">During a time when knowledge and awareness are rapidly growing, the challenge of our time is putting our knowledge and passions to good use. Starting is always the hardest step- and where to begin? A small act can pull ripples that change lives. Here at Ripple, we provide a way for everyone to make a difference while growing themselves. </p>

    <p id= "instructions">Ripple was created by Taylor Chapman,16, and Mandy Leung, 16. Ripple is the result of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program that Chapman and Leung participated in the summer of 2018. The summer program was based at Goldman Sachsâ€™ location in lower Manhattan, and the experience of being around such a wealth of opportunity inspired the two girls to create this platform. </p>

    <p id= "instructions">Chapman and Leung wanted to create a product that allows anyone to become active and involved with causes that they are passionate about. Ripple takes away the boundary of only being able to contribute to causes you care about through donating money from your pocket. </p>
